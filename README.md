## What is the goal?

The purpose is to provide a `pipeline that enables the fastest possible` a hello world app deployment : 
  - [x] each deployment will trigger the next one, and this for `15 minutes without disturbing the user experience`. 
  - [x] the web user should not get any errors during the deployments.


## Hello World application?

This Hello World application is composed of a single HTML page including javascript code with the following requirements : 
  - [x]  to refresh every 5 seconds 
  - [x]  to show the # of the deployment for the day
  - [x]  to show the seconds counting on the page

## How the application is deployed in non disruptive maner?

The application is deployed on AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) using the `rolling update strategy` offer by K8S. 
It will replaces pods running the old version of the application with the new version, one by one, without downtime to the cluster.

## What you should know about GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is CI/CD platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.

A GitHub Action workflow is pipeline equivalent of a jenkins pipeline described in Jenkinsfile : 
  - It is split in jobs. 
  - A job is running on a GitHUb runner
  - You can run multiple jobs in parallel
  - a workflow can be triggered in multiple ways : git push, pull request change...
  
An Action is a custom application that performs a complex and repeated task. It is equivalent of Jenkins plugins.

A GitHub runner is a build agent that can be GitHub hosted or self-hosted. A runner can only process one job at a time.
